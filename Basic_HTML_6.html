	<h1>Hope is a thing with feathers</h1>
	<h4>by Emily Dickinson</h4>
	<p><Section>
	<span style="color:#fff8dc; text-align: center;">Hope</span>
	<span style="color:blue; text-align: center;">	is the thing with feathers<br>
	That perches in the soul,<br>
	And sings the tune without the words,<br>
	And never stops at all,<br>
<br>
	And sweetest in the gale is heard;<br>
	And sore must be the storm<br>
	That could abash the little bird<br>
	That kept so many warm.<br>
<br>
	Iâ€™ve heard it in the chillest land,<br>
	And on the strangest sea;<br>
	Yet, never, in extremity,<br>
	It asked a crumb of me.<br></span>
